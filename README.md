This project aims to predict the stock prices of Indian companies using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is highly effective for sequential data like stock prices. 
By leveraging historical data, this project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in forecasting stock trends.
